# Rosa Weather Integration - Technical Implementation Details

## Overview
This document details the technical journey and final implementation of weather functionality in Rosa's custom backend, focusing on the challenges faced and solutions implemented.

## Architecture Evolution

### Initial Approach (Failed)
- **Attempted**: Direct Daily.co Python SDK integration for sending app messages
- **Issue**: Required separate Daily.co API key; Tavus manages Daily.co infrastructure
- **Learning**: Tavus provides Daily.co rooms but doesn't expose direct API access

### Second Approach (Failed)
- **Attempted**: Detect weather keywords in utterances and trigger UI updates
- **Issue**: Fragile pattern matching; timing issues between backend and frontend
- **Learning**: Text parsing from conversation events is unreliable

### Final Solution (Working)
- **Pattern**: Backend stores weather data â†’ Frontend polls for updates
- **Key Insight**: Since we use custom OpenAI backend (not Tavus tools), we don't get `conversation.tool_call` events

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Flow
```
1. User asks about weather
2. Tavus sends request to our OpenAI-compatible endpoint
3. Our backend calls OpenAI with weather function
4. Weather function executes and stores data by session ID
5. Backend returns streaming response with weather info
```

### Frontend Flow
```
1. WeatherHandler component polls backend every 2 seconds
2. Polls only when meeting state is 'joined-meeting'
3. Fetches from /latest-weather/{conversationId}
4. Updates UI when new weather data detected
```

## Key Components

### Backend (rosa_pattern1_api.py)
- **Session Management**: Maps conversation IDs to Daily.co URLs
- **Weather Storage**: Stores by session ID for multi-conversation support
- **Function Handling**: Intercepts OpenAI function calls and stores results

### Frontend (WeatherHandler.tsx)
- **Polling Mechanism**: Checks for weather updates every 2 seconds
- **Meeting State Awareness**: Uses `useMeetingState()` hook
- **Deduplication**: Tracks last location to prevent duplicate updates

## Critical Implementation Details

### Why Polling Instead of Events?
- We use custom OpenAI backend, not Tavus's built-in LLM
- Tavus tool call events only fire for Tavus-managed tools
- Our backend handles function calling independently

### Session ID Management
```javascript
// Stored globally when conversation created
(window as any).currentConversationId = conversation.conversation_id;
```

### Weather Data Structure
```typescript
interface WeatherData {
  location: string;
  country?: string;
  temperature: number;
  condition: string;
  humidity: number;
  windSpeed: number;
  success: boolean;
}
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For GPT-4.1 (gpt-4-turbo) [[memory:4002432]]
- `WEATHER_API_KEY`: For WeatherAPI.com service
- `TAVUS_API_KEY`: For creating conversations

### No Daily.co API Key Required
- Tavus manages Daily.co infrastructure
- We work within Tavus's WebRTC framework
- App messages handled through polling, not direct API

## Performance Characteristics
- **Polling Interval**: 2 seconds
- **Weather API Response**: ~200-400ms
- **UI Update Latency**: 2-3 seconds max from function call
- **Memory**: Minimal - only stores latest weather per session

## Edge Cases Handled
1. **Multiple Conversations**: Each session has isolated weather data
2. **Meeting State Transitions**: Polling starts only after joining
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Same location won't trigger re-render
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if backend unavailable

## Maintenance Notes
- Weather function defined in WEATHER_FUNCTION constant
- Polling interval hardcoded to 2000ms (adjustable)
- Session cleanup happens on conversation end
- No persistent storage - all in-memory
