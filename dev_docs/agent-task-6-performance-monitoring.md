# Task: Performance Monitoring System

**Priority**: Observability (Merge Last)  
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes  
**Dependencies**: All previous tasks (monitors their performance)

## Objective

Create performance monitoring and metrics collection system to track avatar loading times and transition performance from all previous optimization tasks.

## Critical Files/Anchors

- @file/examples/cvi-ui-conversation/src/utils/logger.ts (reference pattern)
- Create new: `examples/cvi-ui-conversation/src/utils/performanceMonitoring.ts`
- Create new: `examples/cvi-ui-conversation/src/utils/latencyMetrics.ts`

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Create performanceMonitoring.ts
Create new file: `examples/cvi-ui-conversation/src/utils/performanceMonitoring.ts`

**Required Metrics:**
```typescript
const performanceMetrics = {
  avatarLoadTime: performance.now(), // Conversation start to first frame
  firstQualityFrame: performance.now(), // Until crisp video
  responseLatency: [], // Array of response times
  transitionSeamlessness: 0, // User perception score
  networkLatency: 0, // Regional performance
  webglFrameRate: 0, // Green screen performance
  videoGenerationTime: 0 // Preload video creation time
};
```

### 2. Create latencyMetrics.ts
Create new file: `examples/cvi-ui-conversation/src/utils/latencyMetrics.ts`

**Metrics Collection:**
- Track speculative_inference performance improvements
- Monitor preloaded video transition timing  
- Measure WebGL rendering performance
- Record WebRTC latency improvements

### 3. Integration Points
Follow existing logging pattern:
- @file/examples/cvi-ui-conversation/src/utils/logger.ts
- Non-intrusive monitoring that doesn't affect performance
- Export metrics for Vienna conference analysis

### 4. Performance Targets
Monitor achievements from previous tasks:
- Task 1: 30-50% loading speed improvement
- Task 2: Zero perceived latency through preloading
- Task 3: <200ms transition timing
- Task 4: 60fps WebGL performance  
- Task 5: <100ms WebRTC response time

## Constraints

- **Create new files only** - no modifications to existing code
- Use existing logger.ts pattern for consistency
- Implement non-intrusive monitoring
- Export metrics for analysis
- Must not impact performance of monitored systems
- Performance: monitoring overhead <1ms

## Verification

- [ ] performanceMonitoring.ts created with comprehensive metrics
- [ ] latencyMetrics.ts created with specific measurements
- [ ] Follows existing logger.ts patterns
- [ ] Non-intrusive monitoring implementation
- [ ] Metrics export functionality working
- [ ] No impact on existing functionality
- [ ] Performance overhead minimized

## Expected Monitoring Capabilities

- **Avatar Loading Performance**: Track improvements from Task 1
- **Transition Quality**: Monitor seamless switching from Task 3
- **Rendering Performance**: WebGL optimization metrics from Task 4
- **Network Latency**: WebRTC improvements from Task 5  
- **User Experience Metrics**: Overall system performance for Vienna conference
